# @eloqjs/nuxt-next-auth

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add --dev @eloqjs/nuxt-next-auth

# Using npm
npm install --save-dev @eloqjs/nuxt-next-auth
```

2. Add the package to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@eloqjs/nuxt-next-auth'],
})
```

3. Create the authentication handler (`NuxtAuthHandler`) and add at least
   one [authentication provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/):
```ts
// file: nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  auth: {
    providers: ['github']
  }
})

// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'

export const authOptions = {
  secret: 'enter-your-secret-here',
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({ clientId: 'enter-your-client-id-here', clientSecret: 'enter-your-client-secret-here' })
  ]
}
export default NuxtAuthHandler(authOptions)
```
- `[..].ts` is a catch-all route, see the [nuxt server docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route)

4. Done! You can now use all user-related functionality, for example:
- application-side (e.g., from `.vue` files):

```ts
const { status, data } = useSession()

status.value // Session status: `unauthenticated`, `loading`, `authenticated`
data.value // Session data, e.g., expiration, user.email, ...

await signIn() // Sign-in the user
await signOut() // Sign-out the user
```
  
- server-side (e.g., from `~/server/api/session.get.ts`):
```ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'
import { authOptions } from '~/server/api/auth/[...]'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event, authOptions)

  if (!session) {
    return { status: 'unauthenticated!' }
  }

  return { status: 'authenticated!', text: 'im protected by an in-endpoint check', session }
})
```

## Development

- Run `yarn dev:prepare` to generate type stubs.
- Use `yarn dev` to start [playground](./playground) in development mode.

## Why another package?

Although there are similarities with [@sidebase/nuxt-auth][sidebase-nuxt-auth-src],
different system design choices have been made, and therefore their usage are also different.

The most important differences are the usage of `useSession` and how we fetch the session.

In [@sidebase/nuxt-auth][sidebase-nuxt-auth-src], each time `useSession` is used, it makes a request to the api to get
the session, which means we have to `await` for the request and this makes our component asynchronous.

```vue

<script setup lang="ts">

const { data } = await useSession({ required: false })

</script>
```

In `@eloqjs/nuxt-next-auth`, the session is fetched on load the auth plugin, which means it's fetched before you page is loaded.
So we don't need to `await` the `useSession` as there are no requests being made. You can use `useSession`
anywhere you want, it's just accessing data stored
with [useState](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/state-management#state-management).

```vue

<script setup lang="ts">

const { data } = useSession()

</script>
```
